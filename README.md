# TelephoneGameDevelopment
Develop a single level of an open source Unity game, and see how the story unfolds.

## Purpose
The purpose of the TelephoneGameDevelopment project is one of education and art. I want to provide those learning Unity (or game development in general) a place to test out their skills. It also allows 

## Base Project
The base project stems from the tutorial found on Unity's website:
https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/puroziekutos/adventure-game-tutorial

## Rules for Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the base project, please use the following procedure as to not waste your time. Feel free to fork your own project if you like.

1. **Open an issue** - The issue should state that you intend to add a new level to the base game. Include some basics about where you are taking the story. We don't need all the details, but if multiple requests come in, we want to be able to sequence them properly.
1. **Develop** - create a branch and write your level. This will be for a perdetermined length of time as to not hold up any other developers on other levels. In addition, please provide tests when applicable. 
1. **Create a Pull Request** 

This procedure is to ensure the story moves forward at a reasonable pace and allow mutliple developer a chance to work on a project.

**If you are not a developer**, or do not have the time to develop, you can still contribute! If you play the game and can think of any additions, we welcome you to create an issue. Make sure to note that you will not be doing the work on the proposed level.
